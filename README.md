    Figure 1. Overview of the different tasks considered in this work. Given a LUS image sequence, we propose approaches for: (orange) predictionof the disease severity score for each input frame and weakly supervised localization of pathological patterns; (pink) aggregation of frame-levelscores for producing predictions on videos; (green) estimation of segmentation masks indicating pathological artifacts.
